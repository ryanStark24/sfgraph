A **local, privacy-first knowledge graph for Salesforce orgs**. `sfgraph` live-syncs your org to a SQLite + vector index on your machine and exposes 19 MCP tools to **Cursor, Claude Code/Desktop, and VS Code**, so the AI you already use can reason about Apex, LWC, Flow, Vlocity, OmniStudio, security, and integrations **without your code or schema ever leaving your laptop**.

> **Disclaimer — v1.0 is a from-the-ground-up TypeScript rewrite.**
> The Python prototype (`sfgraph@0.1.x`) is retired. The new implementation is in TypeScript, runs as an MCP server, ships per-org SQLite + vector storage, and exposes a stable tool surface. **See [Why we pivoted from Python to TypeScript](#why-we-pivoted-from-python-to-typescript) below for the rationale.** If you were on the Python version, install fresh; there is no auto-migration path because the storage backend is incompatible.

## Privacy pillars

1. **No codebase egress.** Graph, vectors, embeddings, logs — all in `~/.sfgraph/`. Nothing is uploaded anywhere by this tool.
2. **Read-only Salesforce access.** Every `jsforce`/`@salesforce/core` connection is wrapped in a Proxy that throws `ReadOnlyViolationError` synchronously on every mutating method (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `deploy`, …). Verified by 41 adversarial tests.
3. **Telemetry default OFF.** If you ever enable it, an allowlist + sanitizer scrubs paths, emails, SF hosts, bearer tokens, UUIDs, and SF Ids before anything is written. **Local file sink only — there is no remote endpoint.** See [`docs/PRIVACY.md`](docs/PRIVACY.md) for the full threat model.
4. **No credentials handled.** Auth is delegated to the `sf` CLI (`~/.sfdx/`). `sfgraph` never sees a password and never persists an access token.

## Quickstart for a brand-new install

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **≥ 20**
- The `sf` CLI installed and authenticated against at least one Salesforce org:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @salesforce/cli       # if you don't already have it
  sf org login web --alias my-prod     # opens a browser; one-time
  sf config set target-org=my-prod     # makes this the default org
  ```
  Verify with `sf org list` — you should see `my-prod` listed and marked as the default target.

**Windows note.** sfgraph runs on Windows 10/11 under Node ≥ 20. Install via `npm install -g @ryanstark24/sfgraph-mcp`; the `sfgraph install` command writes the MCP host config with `npx.cmd` (not `npx`) so Claude Code / Cursor on Windows invoke the right binary. Make sure Git LFS is installed before `npm install` so the vendored embedding model resolves on first ingest.

### Step 1 — Install sfgraph

```bash
npm install -g @ryanstark24/sfgraph-mcp
# or use it on-demand via npx (no install):
#   npx @ryanstark24/sfgraph-mcp <command>
```

After global install, the binary is available as `sfgraph` on your PATH.

### Step 2 — Wire it into Cursor / Claude Code / VS Code

```bash
sfgraph install
```

This is **idempotent and reversible**. It does two things:
- Copies 10 skill playbooks (`SKILL.md` files) into `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.cursor/rules/`.
- Adds a `sfgraph` entry to your editor's MCP config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.config/Code/User/mcp.json`). Existing MCP entries are preserved.

Use `sfgraph install --dry-run` to see what would be written without writing. Use `--target=claude` (or `cursor`/`vscode`) to wire only one editor.

### Step 3 — Run the **initial ingestion** of your org

This is the part new users always ask about. The first ingest does a **full sync** of every metadata type the org exposes. On a 50K-node sandbox it takes about **2–6 minutes** depending on which packages are installed (Vlocity-CMT and OmniStudio-on-Core add records-heavy retrievals). Subsequent ingests on a Source-Tracking-enabled org are **incremental** and finish in under 30 seconds.

```bash
# Uses the default org from `sf config get target-org`
sfgraph ingest

# Or explicitly pick an org
sfgraph ingest --org my-prod

# Sandbox vs prod? Just run it twice with different aliases:
sfgraph ingest --org my-sandbox
sfgraph ingest --org my-prod
```

What you'll see during initial ingest (annotated):

```
ingest: using default org from sf config: my-prod
ingest: resolving auth from ~/.sfdx/                       ← read-only Proxy wrapped here
ingest: probing capabilities…
ingest: capabilities { vlocityNamespaces: ['vlocity_cmt'],
                       omnistudioOncore: true,
                       sourceTracking: false,              ← prod usually has this off
                       experienceCloud: true,
                       agentforce: false }
ingest: discovered 187 metadata types via describeMetadata()
ingest: creating pre-sync snapshot (this is what `what_broke` looks back to)
ingest: fan-out — Tooling pool (5), Metadata pool (3), Data pool (10)
ingest:   Apex                                ✓ 1248 classes, 89 triggers
ingest:   LWC bundles                         ✓ 234 bundles
ingest:   Flow                                ✓ 412
ingest:   CustomObject                        ✓ 89 standard + 184 custom
ingest:   Profile + PermissionSet             ✓ 47 profiles, 156 perm sets
ingest:   Vlocity (vlocity_cmt)               ✓ 48 DataPack types
ingest:   OmniStudio native                   ✓ 67 OmniProcess + 23 OmniDataTransform
ingest: populating cached analysis tables…
ingest: cross-flavor resolver: 23 CANONICAL_OF edges (Vlocity ↔ OmniStudio)
ingest: embedding queue draining…             ← runs in parallel to parsing
ingest: complete mode=full members=12483 deletions=0 parseErrors=2 elapsed=247314ms
```

The result lands in `~/.sfgraph/<orgId>.sqlite`. From here on, every MCP tool reads from this file — no network calls.

### Step 4 — Open Cursor / Claude / VS Code and ask questions

Restart your IDE so it picks up the new MCP entry. Then in any project, ask the agent:

- *"What does this PR break?"* — agent invokes `sf-impact-from-diff`
- *"Who can edit `Account.Status__c`?"* — agent invokes `sf-security-audit`
- *"What changed in prod since last week?"* — agent invokes `sf-cross-org-diff`
- *"Show me how `accountTile` flows from UI to DB"* — agent invokes `sf-cross-layer-trace`

### Step 5 — Keep the graph fresh

The graph is a snapshot of what the org looked like at last ingest. Re-run `sfgraph ingest` periodically (or before any analysis where staleness matters). Skills warn you when the data is **older than 7 days**.

```bash
sfgraph ingest                       # re-sync; incremental on Source-Tracking orgs
sfgraph snapshot list                # see all snapshots
sfgraph snapshot create --label "before-mass-deploy"   # take a labeled snapshot
```

#### Refreshing multiple orgs at once

```bash
# Explicit alias list, sequentially:
sfgraph ingest --orgs prod,uat,qa

# Every authenticated org from `sf`, sequentially:
sfgraph ingest --all

# Same, but fan out concurrently (per-org failures don't kill the batch):
sfgraph ingest --orgs prod,uat,qa --parallel
sfgraph ingest --all --parallel
```

Each run prints a per-org results table (Org | Mode | Members | Deletions | ParseErrors | Elapsed | Status). With `--parallel`, the rate-limit pools (Tooling 5 / Metadata 3 / Data 10) are shared across orgs in the same process — Bottleneck handles concurrent `schedule()` calls and the conservative budget stays well under per-token SF limits.

#### Full rebuild from scratch

```bash
sfgraph ingest --rebuild --org prod
# Existing graph moved to ~/<sfgraph-data>/backups/<orgId>.rebuild-<ISO>.sqlite

sfgraph ingest --rebuild --no-backup --org prod
# Existing graph deleted outright (no backup taken)
```

`--rebuild` forces `mode=full` regardless of Source Tracking and starts from an empty DB. Useful when parser logic has changed and you want a clean reparse, or when you suspect the graph has drifted from reality.

#### Snapshot management

```bash
sfgraph snapshot list                                       # all snapshots for current org
sfgraph snapshot create --label "before-deploy-v42"         # labelled manual snapshot
sfgraph snapshot create --label "nightly-2026-01-15" --kind scheduled
sfgraph snapshot diff snap_abc123 current                   # diff a snap vs. current graph
sfgraph snapshot diff snap_abc123 snap_def456               # diff two snaps
sfgraph snapshot prune --retain-days 30                     # delete auto-snapshots older than 30d
sfgraph snapshot delete snap_abc123                         # delete a specific snapshot
```

Pre-sync auto-snapshots are created automatically by `sfgraph ingest`; the CLI commands above are for manual / scheduled snapshots.

#### Detect deletions on a full sync

```bash
sfgraph ingest --detect-deletions --org prod
```

On Source-Tracking-enabled orgs, deletions surface automatically via `SourceMember.IsNameObsolete` during incremental sync. On production orgs without Source Tracking, full syncs don't see what's gone — they only see what currently exists. `--detect-deletions` computes the set of qnames present in the graph before the sync but NOT touched during it, and removes them. **Bails out if any parse error occurred during the run** so a transient SF API hiccup never wipes the graph.

### Custom embedding model

sfgraph ships a vendored, quantized **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model that runs locally via `@xenova/transformers` (WASM, zero network). If you need a different model — a domain-tuned one, a multilingual variant, or your own internal embedding — point sfgraph at it:

```bash
# CLI flag (per-invocation)
sfgraph ingest --embed-model /path/to/model.onnx

# Environment variable (persistent)
export SFGRAPH_EMBED_MODEL=/path/to/model.onnx
```

The model must produce 384-dimensional vectors to match the existing `vec0` schema. The first embed of an ingest loads the model lazily; subsequent ingests of unchanged content short-circuit on the cached `content_hash` and never re-embed.

### Parallel org ingest

Bottleneck rate-limit pools live **per Node process**. That means:

- Multiple `sfgraph ingest` processes for **different orgs** run in parallel and don't fight each other — each has its own Tooling/Metadata/Data pools, and Salesforce's per-org API budgets are also separate. Spawn one process per org.
- Multiple `sfgraph ingest` processes for the **same org** are not supported and will contend on the SQLite write lock. Don't do this.
- A single process can serially ingest several orgs (`sfgraph ingest --org A && sfgraph ingest --org B`), but throughput is lower than two parallel processes.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full ingestion-pipeline deep-dive.

## Why we pivoted from Python to TypeScript

`sfgraph` started as a Python project (`sfgraph@0.1.x` on PyPI). v1.0 is a clean-room TypeScript rewrite. Four reasons drove the pivot:

1. **MCP-native tooling.** [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) has first-class SDK support in TypeScript. The `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package gives us stdio transport, schema validation, and tool dispatch for free. The Python MCP ecosystem exists but trails the TypeScript one in stability and feature parity. For a tool whose primary surface *is* MCP, picking the better-supported language was a one-way decision.
2. **Salesforce ecosystem alignment.** The official `@salesforce/cli`, `@salesforce/core`, and `jsforce` libraries are all TypeScript. Running on the same runtime as the user's `sf` CLI means we read `~/.sfdx/` auth state with zero translation, no wrapper, and no separate token cache.
3. **Single-binary distribution via npm.** A Salesforce developer almost always has Node.js installed (it powers `sf`, Vlocity Build, Codey, sfdx-source-deploy). Asking them to also install Python 3.12 + a virtualenv + `uv` was friction. `npx @ryanstark24/sfgraph-mcp install` runs on any machine that already has `sf` working.
4. **Strict typing for a graph engine.** sfgraph's value depends on the integrity of `NodeFact` / `EdgeFact` shapes across ~25 metadata categories. TypeScript with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, and `verbatimModuleSyntax` catches at compile-time the same class of bugs that Python's `mypy --strict` catches at lint time — and the rest of the stack (Biome, Vitest, Changesets) was already in that ecosystem.

The Python codebase is retired; no v0.x branches are maintained. If you're upgrading, install the npm package and re-ingest. There is no data migration because the storage layer changed from DuckDB / FalkorDB to SQLite + sqlite-vec (see [Design decisions](#design-decisions-in-v10) below).

---

## Design decisions in v1.0

Major architectural choices and why they were made. Each one was a deliberate decision, not a default.

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Storage backend** | SQLite + sqlite-vec, one file per org | Zero-install. Survives reboots. WAL journaling. vec0 partitions by `org_id` so cross-org search never spills into the wrong org. DuckDB was faster on some scans but added a 60MB native binary and concurrency complexity for stdio servers. |
| **Schema model** | Per-label node tables + per-rel-type edge tables, lazy CREATE | Composite PKs `(org_id, qualified_name)` on nodes, reverse-traversal index `(org_id, dst_qname)` on edges. "Who depends on X?" is as cheap as "what does X depend on?". |
| **Embeddings** | MiniLM-L6-v2 quantized ONNX, vendored via Git LFS, run in-process by transformers.js | No external embedding service. 384-dim vectors. ~30 MB binary that ships once. Batched inference in a side-stream queue so parsing never blocks. |
| **Parser dispatch** | `conn.metadata.describe()` at ingest start → runtime type registry | No hardcoded type list. New Salesforce releases or installed packages surface immediately. Unknown types route to a generic opaque-node parser; the graph is never blind. |
| **Code parsers vs. rules** | 6 code parsers (Apex/LWC/Flow/Object + 4 Vlocity JSON), 21 YAML rule files for the rest | Apex AST and LWC bundle work are too complex for declarative rules. Everything else (Profile, Layout, Workflow, Report, …) is field/edge mapping that fits in 30 lines of YAML. |
| **Vlocity coverage** | Vendor `vlocity_build/QueryDefinitions.yaml` (MIT), probe all 5 industry namespaces | Vlocity is in maintenance mode; the registry is stable. Vendoring is a 50-line file, not a runtime dependency on the `vlocity` npm package (which is a CLI binary, not a library). |
| **Cross-flavor resolver** | Post-pass that emits `CANONICAL_OF` edges between Vlocity-CMT and OmniStudio-on-Core duplicates | Many orgs are mid-migration. The agent treats `DataRaptor:X` and `OmniDataTransform:X` as the same logical asset without forcing the user to disambiguate. |
| **Live sync auth** | Delegated to `sf` CLI / `@salesforce/core` | We never see passwords. Token lives in `~/.sfdx/`. Re-using the user's existing login means zero new credentials to manage. |
| **Read-only enforcement** | Runtime Proxy, not just convention | Every mutating method on `jsforce` throws synchronously. Verified by 41 adversarial tests against the full method surface. Belt and braces vs. "we promise we don't write." |
| **Telemetry sink** | `LocalFileSink` only; no remote endpoint exists in the codebase | The pipeline has a slot for an HTTP sink reserved for v1.1, but it's not implemented. Local-only is a code-level guarantee, not a config flag. |
| **Rate limiting** | Three independent Bottleneck pools (Tooling 5 / Metadata 3 / SObject 10) | Salesforce throttles per-API. Separate budgets let us hit ~18 concurrent calls without violating any single limit. |
| **MCP tool envelope** | `{ summary, markdown, data, follow_up_tools? }` | Agents read `summary`. Humans read `markdown`. Programmatic consumers read `data`. `follow_up_tools` lets skills compose. |
| **Incremental sync** | `SourceMember` polling on Source-Tracking-enabled orgs | One Tooling SOQL, refetch only changed members. Sub-30s on sandboxes. Falls back to full sync on production orgs without source tracking. |

### What v1.0 brings that v0.x didn't

- **Real MCP server** instead of a CLI-only Python tool — works natively with Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code without shell-out tricks.
- **Multi-org** as a first-class concept — every row in storage is partitioned by `org_id`; cross-org diff is one graph query.
- **Typed semantic edges** (`READS_FIELD`, `CALLS_DR`, `INVOKES_REMOTE_ACTION`, `GRANTS_FIELD_ACCESS`, …) replace the v0 heuristic walker's generic `REFERENCES`. ~80 typed relationship types now.
- **Snapshots + point-in-time diff** built into the storage layer. v0 had no notion of "what did the org look like an hour ago".
- **Cross-flavor resolver** for Vlocity ↔ OmniStudio. v0 treated them as separate worlds.
- **Capability-driven dispatch**: new metadata types ship with Salesforce releases and are picked up automatically. v0's parser dispatch was hardcoded per type.
- **Declarative rule engine** for parser authoring — adding support for a new type is a YAML file, not a Python module.
- **Vendored embedding model** (transformers.js + MiniLM-L6 ONNX) — v0 hit Qdrant / FastEmbed which required a separate service. v1 is process-local.

## The 19 MCP tools (summary)

Every tool returns `{ summary, markdown, data, follow_up_tools? }`. The `markdown` includes a Mermaid block when a diagram aids comprehension.

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Inventory & freshness** | `ping`, `start_ingest_job`, `get_ingest_job`, `snapshot_create`, `snapshot_list`, `point_in_time_diff`, `freshness_report` |
| **Impact analysis** | `analyze_field`, `trace_upstream`, `trace_downstream`, `cross_layer_flow_map`, `cross_org_diff`, `impact_from_git_diff`, `test_gap_intelligence_from_git_diff`, `what_broke` |
| **Quality, security, deployment** | `governor_risk_check`, `dead_code_audit`, `security_audit`, `deployment_manifest_gen` |

Per-tool input/output samples and the algorithm each one uses live in [`docs/TOOLS.md`](docs/TOOLS.md). The "How the analysis actually works" section below explains the dispatch flow.

---

## The 15 skill playbooks

When you `sfgraph install`, 15 `SKILL.md` files land in `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.cursor/rules/`. They route LLM intent to tool sequences so the agent picks up the right tool without you having to name it.

| Skill | Triggers like… | Tools used |
|---|---|---|
| `sf-impact-from-diff` | "what does this PR break", "impact of this diff" | `impact_from_git_diff`, `test_gap_intelligence_from_git_diff` |
| `sf-wip-impact` | "what does my WIP touch", "before I commit" | `wip_impact`, `wip_diff`, `wip_test_gap` |
| `sf-what-broke` | "what broke", "post-deploy regression", "since deploy" | `what_broke`, `point_in_time_diff` |
| `sf-cross-layer-trace` | "how does this LWC reach the DB", "end-to-end path" | `cross_layer_flow_map`, `analyze_field` |
| `sf-dead-code-audit` | "what can I delete", "unused", "dead code" | `dead_code_audit`, `freshness_report`, `trace_upstream` |
| `sf-governor-risk-fix` | "SOQL in loop", "will this scale", "performance review" | `governor_risk_check` |
| `sf-flow-impact` | "which flows use this field", "flow impact" | `analyze_field`, `trace_upstream` |
| `sf-security-audit` | "FLS", "who has access", "sharing rules" | `security_audit`, `analyze_field` |
| `sf-cross-org-diff` | "sandbox vs prod", "what changed in prod" | `cross_org_diff`, `point_in_time_diff` |
| `sf-deployment-manifest` | "generate package.xml", "deploy these changes" | `deployment_manifest_gen`, `cross_org_diff` |
| `sf-omnistudio-migration-audit` | "Vlocity → OmniStudio status", "migration audit" | `cross_org_diff` + direct queries |
| `sf-schema-overview` | "describe this org's schema", "object topology" | `analyze_field`, `trace_upstream` |
| `sf-snapshot-compare` | "compare these snapshots", "what changed between releases" | `snapshot_list`, `point_in_time_diff` |
| `sf-metadata-refresh` | "re-ingest", "refresh the graph" | `start_ingest_job`, `get_ingest_job`, `staleness_check` |
| `sf-explain-code` | "explain `Foo.bar`", "walk me through this method" | `explain_code`, `trace_downstream`, `staleness_check` |

Every skill includes a **Visualization** section specifying the Mermaid diagram type the agent should render (flowchart LR for impact, sequenceDiagram for cross-layer trace, erDiagram for schema questions, gitGraph for point-in-time). Skills also chain to each other via `follow_up_tools`.

See [`docs/SKILLS.md`](docs/SKILLS.md) for each playbook in full.

---

## Metadata coverage

Coverage is **dynamic, not hardcoded**. At ingest start, `conn.metadata.describe(apiVersion)` asks the org for its full supported type list — which automatically includes any types added by installed managed packages or by new Salesforce releases. Each type is routed to either a code parser, a declarative YAML rule, or the generic opaque-node fallback.

**Code parsers (6, complex AST work)**: Apex, LWC, Flow, Object, 4 Vlocity JSON content parsers.

**Declarative rules (21 YAML files)**: Profile, PermissionSet, SharingRule, NamedCredential, ExternalServiceRegistration, PlatformEvent, ApexPage, ApexComponent, Layout, LightningPage, Report, Dashboard, GenAiPlanner, GenAiPlugin, Network, Workflow, ApprovalProcess, DuplicateRule, MatchingRule, CustomMetadataType, CustomLabel, PermissionSetGroup.

**Vlocity legacy industry clouds** — all 5 namespaces covered by a single vendored registry (`vlocity_build`'s `QueryDefinitions.yaml`, MIT, 48 DataPack types):

| Namespace | Industry cloud(s) |
|---|---|
| `vlocity_cmt` | Communications, Media, Energy & Utilities |
| `vlocity_ins` | Insurance |
| `vlocity_hc` | Health |
| `vlocity_ps` | Public Sector |
| `vlocity_fs` | Financial Services (legacy) |

**Anything else** — types `describeMetadata()` lists but no rule covers — emits an opaque NodeFact with raw fields so the agent can still answer "does X exist?". Zero-day coverage.

---

## How the analysis actually works

Every tool answers a question by traversing a typed property graph stored locally in SQLite. The graph is built ingest-time by capability-driven parsers; analysis at query-time is mostly bounded graph traversal plus a few cached scores.

### The underlying graph

- **Nodes** (`NodeFact`): one per metadata entity. Keyed by `(org_id, qualified_name)`. Stored in per-label SQLite tables (`_sfg_n_apexclass`, `_sfg_n_lwc`, `_sfg_n_customfield`, …) created lazily on first ingest.
- **Edges** (`EdgeFact`): typed relationships. Keyed by `(org_id, src_qname, dst_qname)` per rel-type table. Each edge table has a reverse-traversal index `(org_id, dst_qname)`.
- **Snapshots**: copy-on-snapshot into `_sfgraph_node_snapshots` / `_sfgraph_edge_snapshots`. Diff is set arithmetic over `qualified_name`.
- **Vectors**: 384-dim embeddings in `vec0(org_id PARTITION KEY, embedding float[384])`. KNN is `MATCH ? AND k = ?`, partition-pruned by org.

Everything is partition-keyed on `org_id`. Same-org queries never read another org's rows.

### How parsers get picked at ingest start

1. **`probeCapabilities()`** detects installed managed packages (Vlocity-CMT and the other 4 industry namespaces, OmniStudio-on-Core, Agentforce, Experience Cloud, Source Tracking).
2. **`conn.metadata.describe(apiVersion)`** asks the org for its full supported type list.
3. The **dispatch table** maps each type to a fetch strategy:
   - `toolingSoql` for code metadata (Apex, LWC, Aura, StaticResource)
   - `metadataReadList` for XML configuration (Profile, Layout, Workflow, …)
   - `vlocityRunner` for legacy DataPacks (gated on `caps.vlocityLegacy`)
4. The **parser registry** routes each fetched record to either a code parser or a declarative rule. Unknown types fall through to a generic-opaque rule.

### Live sync algorithm

1. **Auth** via `@salesforce/core` from `~/.sfdx/`. Connection is wrapped in `wrapConnectionReadOnly()`.
2. **Capability probe** — parallel `describe` calls.
3. **Discover metadata types** — `conn.metadata.describe(apiVersion)` returns the org's supported type list.
4. **Load rule files** — `loadAllRules()` zod-validates and registers all `*.yml` in `parsers/rules/`.
5. **Build dispatch table** — per-type fetch strategy.
6. **Pre-sync snapshot** — `is_auto=true` snapshot; this is what `what_broke` looks back to.
7. **Decide mode** — incremental if `caps.sourceTracking && org.last_synced_at` exists, else full.
8. **Fan out across three pools** — toolingPool (5), metadataPool (3), dataPool (10). Each has its own 429+Retry-After handler.
9. **For each member** → parser → `mergeNodes` / `mergeEdges`. Content-hash short-circuit: unchanged records skip the write.
10. **Embedding queue (side-stream)** — push `{ qname, text }` per new node; queue batches 16-at-a-time and invokes transformers.js MiniLM. Vectors land in `vec0`.
11. **Cross-flavor resolver** — emits `CANONICAL_OF` edges between Vlocity ↔ OmniStudio duplicates.
12. **Populate analysis tables** — governor risks, dead-code scores, test coverage, security findings.
13. **Touch sync timestamp** and **drain embedding queue + prune snapshots**.

### Why this design is fast

- **Reverse-edge index** makes "who depends on X?" as cheap as "what does X depend on?".
- **Composite PKs partition every table by org_id** — SQLite range-scans only the rows for the org in question.
- **Content-hash short-circuit** on merge means no write amplification on unchanged metadata.
- **Cached analysis tables** turn governor / dead-code / security audits from full-table scans into single SELECTs.
- **vec0 partition key** prunes vector search to one org.

## Sample agent conversations

### Before merging a PR

```
User: I'm about to merge this PR. Anything I should worry about?

Agent: *invokes sf-impact-from-diff*
       → impact_from_git_diff(diff="…", depth=3)
       → test_gap_intelligence_from_git_diff(diff="…")

       Your diff touches 3 nodes. 9 dependents at 3 hops:
         • 4 covered by tests (green)
         • 5 at-risk (no IS_TEST_FOR):
             - LWC:opportunityTile
             - ApexMethod:BillingSvc.run(2)
             - ApexMethod:BillingSvc.dryRun(0)
             - Flow:Order_Status_Update
             - LWC:invoiceTile

       [Mermaid: changed=red, at_risk=yellow, covered=green]

       Recommend adding test coverage for BillingSvc.run(2) before merging.
```

### Picking an org for cross-org compare

```
User: What's different between sandbox and prod?

Agent: *invokes sf-cross-org-diff*
       → first checks: which orgs are authenticated via sf CLI?

       I see these orgs in your `sf` config:
         • my-prod (default)        last ingested 6 days ago
         • my-sandbox               last ingested 2 hours ago
         • integration-uat          NOT yet ingested

       Want to compare my-prod ↔ my-sandbox?
       [user: yes]

       → cross_org_diff(org_a='my-prod', org_b='my-sandbox', category='all')

       Differences:
         • Only in my-sandbox: 12 ApexClasses, 3 Flows, 2 CustomFields
         • Only in my-prod:    1 deprecated trigger
         • Changed (different hash): 7 nodes

       Note: my-prod ingest is 6 days old. Run `sfgraph ingest --org my-prod`
       for a fresher comparison.

       Tip: to refresh both at once, run
         `sfgraph ingest --orgs my-prod,my-sandbox --parallel`
       (or `sfgraph ingest --all --parallel` to refresh every authenticated org).
```

### Initial onboarding

```
User: I just installed sfgraph. Where do I start?

Agent: 1. Check the `sf` CLI is authenticated:
          `sf org list` — should show at least one org marked default.
       2. Run initial ingest (this is the slow step; ~2-6 min):
          `sfgraph ingest`
       3. Restart your IDE so the MCP server picks up the new tools.
       4. Ask me a question. Examples:
          - "Show me a schema overview of the Account object."
          - "Who reads Account.Status__c?"
          - "What's the cross-layer path from accountTile to the DB?"
```

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.sfgraph/<orgId>.sqlite` | Per-org graph + vectors (single file) |
| `~/.sfgraph/backups/*.sqlite` | Pre-migration backups (rolling, last 5) |
| `~/.sfgraph/workspaces/<projectHash>.json` | Project-to-org binding for WIP analysis |
| `~/.config/sfgraph/sfgraph.json` | Telemetry config (default off) |
| `~/.config/sfgraph/machine-id` | Random UUID — only created if you enable telemetry |
| `~/.claude/skills/sf-*` | 10 SKILL.md playbooks for Claude |
| `~/.cursor/rules/sf-*.mdc` | Same, Cursor flavor |
| `<MCP-config>.json` | MCP server entry (per editor) |

What is **never** stored locally by `sfgraph`: passwords, access tokens (they stay in `~/.sfdx/` owned by `sf`), or your codebase content (telemetry events are field-allowlisted).
